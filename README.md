Self Driving Car is a small project with a big ambition. We aim to be competitive with Google's Self Driving Car. We're doing it open source and cheaper!

Self Driving Car is created and maintained by [Self Driving Vehicle Hackers](http://meetup.com/Self-Driving-Vehicle).

Praful is volunteering his car (2004 Toyota Corolla!) and it'd be great if we could get others to volunteer as well. 

> We're starting off attaching sensors to my car and from a past life I have a bunch of computers specifically designed for car installations. 
Additionally, I have a bunch of Linux-compatible wireless cards from AT&T (though you'll have to activate them under your own plan). 
You may choose to collect data without a connection and upload it to the site later so we can all use the data to develop code.

There will be no automated vehicle control in the initial stages. 
As we become more confident in our approach, we will take it for a test spin in a closed off parking lot. 

It would be awesome if we can get it to drive on the highway (with a human acting as a driver instructor with a separate brake).
