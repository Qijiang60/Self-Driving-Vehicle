Self Driving Car
====

We want to build the equivalent of the Google car.
There's a Udacity course on self-driving car so let's put that to practice.

I'm volunteering my car and it'd be great if we could get others to volunteer as well.
We're starting off attaching sensors to my car and from a past life I have a bunch of computers specifically designed for car installations.
Additionally, I have a bunch of Linux-compatible wireless cards from AT&T (though you'll have to activate them under your own plan).
You may choose to collect data without a connection and upload it to the site later so we can all use the data to develop code.

There will be no automated vehicle control in the initial stages. 
As we become more confident in our approach, we will take it for a test spin in a closed off parking lot. 
It would be awesome if we can get it to drive on the highway (with a human i.e. me acting as a driver instructor with a separate brake).
