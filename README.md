Self Driving Vehicle is a small project with a big ambition. We aim to build a Self Driving Vehicle (SDV) on par with Google's efforts. We're doing it open source and cheaper!

SDV is created and maintained by [SDV Hackers](http://meetup.com/Self-Driving-Vehicle).

[dasickis](http://www.github.com/dasickis) is volunteering his car (2004 Toyota Corolla!) and it'd be great if we could get others to volunteer as well. 

> We're starting off attaching sensors to my car and from a past life I have a bunch of computers specifically designed for car installations. 
Additionally, I have a bunch of Linux-compatible wireless cards from AT&T (though you'll have to activate them under your own plan). 
You may choose to collect data without a connection and upload it to the site later so we can all use the data to develop code.

There will be no automated vehicle control in the initial stages. 
As we become more confident in our approach, we will take it for a test spin in a closed off parking lot. 

It would be awesome if we can get it to drive on the highway (with a human acting as a driver instructor with a separate brake).

## Project Overview

Currently we're working an overview of the application architecture. At this point, we're stubbing out all the methods and writing logic in conceptual comments. Please fork the project and pull-request your changes. Any problems, please open up issues so we can resolve them quickly.
